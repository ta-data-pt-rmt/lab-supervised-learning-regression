    "You may obtain the impression from this lab that without knowing statistical methods in depth, it is difficult to make major progress in machine learning. That is correct. If you are motivated to become a data scientist, statistics is the subject you must be proficient in and there is no shortcut. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Data engineers who need to be good at programming.\n",
